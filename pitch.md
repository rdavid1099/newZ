#### New-Z
#### Pitch

Connecting the community with their local news stations to create a better product and more informed public.

#### Problem

Local news stations have forgotten about those they serve and thus are creating inferior products.  News producers often come from around the country and do not have the best understanding of the demands of community.

#### Solution

Bridge the communication gap between viewers and producers.  Instead of news producers choosing stories based on what THEY think their audience wants to hear, open up a line of dialogue and create a two-way conversation.  Technology now enables us to give and receive feedback, and that feedback can help producers curate the best content for the community they serve.

#### Target Audience

The app is intended to be used by local news producers and viewers.  Initially, any producer and any viewer can sign up for the app, but as it gains traction, news stations will be required to subscribe to the service, allowing its producers to access the site.  Viewers can then subscribe to the active news stations in their area.
