AS A VIEWER...
When I visit the root page
I expect to see a stylish page describing the functionality and mission of NewZ
And I expect to see large buttons 'More Information' and 'Login Using Twitter'

When I click on the 'More Information'
I expect to see a more in-depth description of NewZ
And I expect to see a list of cities and stations subscribing to the service

When I click on 'Login Using Twitter' in the navbar
I expect to be taken to the Twitter Login page and asked to grant permission for Twitter to access basic profile information

After granting access to Twitter information
I expect to be taken to a page listing all of the subscribed stations near my location

If I don't have a location listed on my Twitter profile
I expect to be taken to a page asking me to enter my zipcode or City and State where I live

If there are no subscribed stations near me
I expect to be taken to the 'Global Community' page
On the 'Global Community' page
I expect to have all the functionality of a regular user
EXCEPT I can only pitch stories to the 'Global Community' and cannot influence or interact with 'Local Communities'

If I have a location entered on my Twitter page and I have at least one station near me subscribed to the service
I expect to be able to check a box subscribing to one or many of the stations listed
And I expect to click the 'Subscribe' button to conclude the initial login process

After clicking the 'Subscribe' button
I expect to be taken to my dashboard page
Where I expect to see the top 5 trending CNN headlines
And I expect to see the 10 most recent pitches I made OR commented on

On my dashboard page
I expect to see a link taking me my 'Inbox'
I also expect to see an 'Edit My Profile' link

In my navbar
I expect to see my Twitter username, a drop-down menu of all the stations I am subscribed to, an envelope taking me to DMs, a pitch a story button, a logout button
and I expect all of the buttons and functionality to be identical to that of Producers
